 1. make the server application using the Makefile
 
	cd ServerApp
	make
	
	The out put file is stringServer
	Use this as out server application
	
2.  Save your program that will run as a service in /usr/sbin

    sudo cp stringServer /usr/sbin/stringServer

3   Copy the script to init.d and set permission

    sudo cp SetAsService/stringServScrpt /etc/init.d/stringServScrpt
    sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/stringServScrpt
	
4.  Set the run level

    cd /etc/init.d
    sudo update-rc.d myscriptname defaults 97 03

    reboot your machine and check if the service has started properly
    sudo ps -A --sort cmd

   if your service is not starting properly, you should first check if it runs when called by hand:
   cd /etc/init.d
   sudo myscriptname -start
